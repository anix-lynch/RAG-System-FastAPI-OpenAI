## ⚡ Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation System with FastAPI

This project involves building a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using **FastAPI** and **OpenAI's API**. The system allows users to upload documents and engage in conversations about the content by leveraging AI-powered semantic search and text generation. The project focuses on integrating AI models with modern API development techniques.

## Project Overview

The aim is to develop a system that combines **retrieval** and **generation** functionalities, providing users with insightful answers based on document content. The system uses **OpenAI's GPT models** for generating responses and **text embeddings** for efficient information retrieval. It also covers the backend development process, from setting up **FastAPI** endpoints to managing **PostgreSQL** databases for storing document data.

Key aspects of the project include designing robust APIs, implementing **text chunking** strategies, and utilizing **OCR** to parse both text and PDF documents. The result is a fully functional RAG system that can handle various types of input documents and provide accurate, AI-generated answers.

### Key Features:

- 📄 **Document Upload and Query**: Users can upload documents and interact with the content through AI-driven conversations.
- 🔍 **Semantic Search**: Efficiently retrieve relevant information from the documents using text embeddings.
- 🧠 **OpenAI GPT Models**: Generate detailed responses based on document content.
- 🚀 **FastAPI for API Management**: Build and manage API endpoints for the system.
- 💾 **PostgreSQL Integration**: Store and manage document data in a structured database.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **OpenAI**: For GPT-based response generation and text embeddings.
- **FastAPI**: Framework for building and managing APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: For handling document storage and queries.
- **OCR**: For parsing text and PDF data from uploaded documents.
